# [gardener-extension-provider-gcp]
## ‚ö†Ô∏è Breaking Changes

## ‚ú® New Features

## üêõ Bug Fixes
* *[OPERATOR]* Fixed an issue that caused the VPA object for `csi-driver-node` to no longer match any Pods and effectively disabled vertical autoscaling for the DaemonSet. ([gardener/gardener-extension-provider-gcp#452](https://github.com/gardener/gardener-extension-provider-gcp/pull/452), [@voelzmo](https://github.com/voelzmo))
* *[OPERATOR]* provider-gcp now mutates the `cluster-autoscaler` Deployment by implementing the `EnsureClusterAutoscalerDeployment` function. This is required in the context of https://github.com/kubernetes/autoscaler/issues/4517 - cluster-autoscaler supports `--feature-gates` flag and provider extensions have to mutate the cluster-autoscaler Deployment to add the CSI related feature gates to it.
