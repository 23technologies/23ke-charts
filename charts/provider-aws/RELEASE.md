# [gardener-extension-provider-aws]
## ‚ö†Ô∏è Breaking Changes
* *[USER]* The `gp2` StorageClass is now removed. ([gardener/gardener-extension-provider-aws#576](https://github.com/gardener/gardener-extension-provider-aws/pull/576), [@StenlyTU](https://github.com/StenlyTU))
* *[OPERATOR]* This version of provider-aws requires Gardener v1.50.0. ([gardener/gardener-extension-provider-aws#562](https://github.com/gardener/gardener-extension-provider-aws/pull/562), [@ialidzhikov](https://github.com/ialidzhikov))
* *[OPERATOR]* This version of provider-aws requires Gardener v1.50+. ([gardener/gardener-extension-provider-aws#571](https://github.com/gardener/gardener-extension-provider-aws/pull/571), [@kris94](https://github.com/kris94))
## ‚ú® New Features
* *[OPERATOR]* `CloudProfileConfig` now supports a new field `.machineImages[].versions[].regions[].architecture`. It specifies the supported CPU architecture of the given machine image AMI. ([gardener/gardener-extension-provider-aws#565](https://github.com/gardener/gardener-extension-provider-aws/pull/565), [@acumino](https://github.com/acumino))
* *[OPERATOR]* `WorkerStatus` now supports a new field `.machineImage[].architecture`. It specifies the supported CPU architecture of the given worker pool. ([gardener/gardener-extension-provider-aws#565](https://github.com/gardener/gardener-extension-provider-aws/pull/565), [@acumino](https://github.com/acumino))
## üêõ Bug Fixes
* *[USER]* Users can now set IOPS for a GP3 volume type. Validation of IOPS (i.e. whether it is allowed and is in the specified range for a volume type) is done on the AWS side, so feedback will arrive once the volume is created. ([gardener/gardener-extension-provider-aws#561](https://github.com/gardener/gardener-extension-provider-aws/pull/561), [@rishabh-11](https://github.com/rishabh-11))
* *[OPERATOR]* provider-aws now mutates the `cluster-autoscaler` Deployment by implementing the `EnsureClusterAutoscalerDeployment` function. This is required in the context of https://github.com/kubernetes/autoscaler/issues/4517 - cluster-autoscaler supports `--feature-gates` flag and provider extensions have to mutate the cluster-autoscaler Deployment to add the CSI related feature gates to it.

  * Please make sure, that you had at least `machine-controller-manager@v0.43.0` running before upgrading to `v0.46.0`, so that it has successfully acquired leadership with the hybrid resource lock (`endpointsleases`) at least once.
